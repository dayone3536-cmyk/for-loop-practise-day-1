# for-loop-practise-day-1
this is my first program on learning for loop in this i firt set the initial count to 0 so that i can increment it later then
i assinged a list to the variable numbers ,
then i used the for loop by typing for num in numbers:
then i gave a condition ttttithe numbers in my numbers list were greter than 6:
assing count again to count +1 to show the final incremented number
then i printed the count
